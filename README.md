# Research Notebook (MSc Thesis)

Hi Evangelos and Luigi 👋

This repository is used to share my ongoing thesis progress ahead of our meetings.  You may optionally review it prior to the meeting to support discussion and feedback.  

➡ **Rendered notes (GitHub Pages):**
https://thygeminator.github.io/research-notebook/

The website contains the readable HTML version of my Quarto/Jupyter notebook

The repository itself only exists to generate the website — the page above is the intended way to read the material.

All content is preliminary and written as working notes rather than a structured report.
Some spelling or grammar errors may be present, as the notes are not proofread and mainly serve as a live record of ideas, code development, and ongoing work.

Thank you!

# Week 1 - Overview

I have been reading a lot of papers. The most notable are seen in the [citation section](https://thygeminator.github.io/research-notebook/#citationss). I have mostly been reading quickly through the papers (it still takes a lot of time), with the aim of not getting full understanding but noting down what seems important. I have found that the Bayesian approach to optimal sensor placement seems like an interesting way to go about the optimal sensor placement, and I have begun the process of getting a better understanding of the Bayesian approach. I have started a detailed reading of the paper:

>Yang, Yichao, Mayank Chadha, Zhen Hu, and Michael D. Todd. 2022. “An Optimal Sensor Placement Design Framework for Structural Health Monitoring Using Bayes Risk.” Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 168 (April): 108618. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108618.

I think that the most interesting parts of my notebook are:

  - [Problem def: Bayes risk](https://thygeminator.github.io/research-notebook/#problem-def-bayes-risk)
    - This is notes for my understanding, and an attempt at reformulating the methods introduced in the paper above to a vibration-based SHM problem.
  - [The notes to paper 3 for optimal sensor placement](https://thygeminator.github.io/research-notebook/#paper-3)
    - This is notes from the paper above with notation for understanding the Bayesian model they implemented.
