# Research Notebook (MSc Thesis)

Hi Evangelos and Luigi 👋

This repository is used to share my ongoing thesis progress ahead of our meetings.  You may optionally review it prior to the meeting to support discussion and feedback.  

➡ **Rendered notes (GitHub Pages):**
https://thygeminator.github.io/research-notebook/

The website contains the readable HTML version of my Quarto/Jupyter notebook, including:

* latest experiments
* figures and intermediate results
* questions for discussion
* weekly progress updates

The repository itself only exists to generate the website — the page above is the intended way to read the material.

All content is preliminary and written as working notes rather than a structured report.
Some spelling or grammar errors may be present, as the notes are not proofread and mainly serve as a live record of ideas, code development, and ongoing work.

Thank you!
